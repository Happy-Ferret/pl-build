# PL Build

This is a repo to test out different node scripts for build processes for our pattern library.

## WIP Ideas

1.  Get json structure of directories (dir tree)
2.  loop through each component
    a. If it has a docs folder then opt into making a docs file
    b. Read the main module, styles, changelog
    c. module.json file in each dir
